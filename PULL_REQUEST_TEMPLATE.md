# Pull Request Template

### :octocat: Are you working in some issue? Identify the issue!

Link the issue describing what you're fixing.

If there is not yet an issue, please open a new one and then link to it in your
pull request. In some cases, one person's "bug" is another person's
"feature", thus the maintainers have the final say on whether the current
behavior is a bug or not.

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Are you improving performance? Tell us the quantitative performance benefits.

Describe the exact performance improvement observed (for example, reduced time
to complete an operation, reduced memory use, etc.). Describe how you measured
this change. Bonus points for including graphs that demonstrate the improvement
or attached dumps from the built-in profiling tools.

If you're not improving performance, you can remove this section.

### :bookmark_tabs: Description of the Change

We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description.
Keep in mind that the maintainer reviewing this PR may not be familiar with or
have worked with the code here recently, so please walk us through the
concepts.

### :computer: Verification Process

What process did you follow to verify that the change has not introduced any
regressions? Describe the actions you performed (including buttons you clicked,
text you typed, commands you ran, etc.), and describe the results you observed.

### :page_facing_up: Release Notes

Please describe the changes in a single line that explains this improvement in
terms that a user can understand. This text will be used in the project's release
notes.

If this change is not user-facing or notable enough to be included in the release
notes you may use the strings "Not applicable" or "N/A" here.

Examples:

- The GitHub package now allows you to add co-authors to commits.
- Fix an issue where multiple cursors did not work in a file with a single line.
- Increase the performance of searching and replacing across a whole project.
